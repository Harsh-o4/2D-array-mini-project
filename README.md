# 2D-arrays
<p> This is a C++ programs to do basic operations and familiarize with the concept of 2D arrays. <br><br>
 This a menu-driven program that can perform the following tasks:
 <ul>
     <li>Input and print 2D array.</li>
     <li>Check for different types of 2D arrays.</li>
     <li>Print different types of arrays.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>How the program runs?</h2>
The program starts with this interface:

<h2 align="center">On clicking 1:</h2>
User is asked for the number of rows and columns of the 2D array to be entered. It then asks whether the elements are to be entered in <b>row-major</b> order or <b>column-major</b> order.

User enters the values of the array one by one. After entering of all the values, final array is displayed. This menu has the options of <b>re-entering the array</b>, <b>going back to the MAIN MENU</b> and <b>terminating the program</b>.

<h2 align="center">On clicking 2:</h2>

User is shown the different <b>types of 2D arrays</b> and can choose any one using the menu.

After choosing a type, there is a small description of that type. This is followed by 2 options- either to make that 2D array or check whether an array is that type.
